# DevOps Ideas

1. Fork and separate the branch to master(dev), staging, prod
2. Improve the Travis(Github)/Pipeline(Bitbucket) for build, test and deploy to AWS EC2
3. Dockerise the app and build, test and deploy via Docker
4. Set up statsd, prometheus and grafana for monitoring
5. Add code to probe certain endpoints for monitoring the reliability, traffic and latency
6. Use a load tester to test the performance and monitor it. Point out the problems
7. Set up a CDN and Application Load Balancer
8. Use Terraform for monitor/infra set up

## Advanced

1. Separate the database, core logic and auth into multiple microservices
2. Generate 10000 DB entries
3. Add an external cache to load entries faster 
4. Introduce autoscaling via EBS

## Other

1. Write a better frontend code in a different repo 
2. Setup deployment for the frontend to S3
3. Point CloudFront to the S3
4. Use Terraform to do the deployment
